This site was build by Roberto Supe Tulcan (PhD candidate) and the research team of [Professor Shiliang Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shiliang_Liu), course coordinator and lecturer of Landscape Ecology at Beijing Normal University. 
We will cover several statistical analysis that can be used in R for Landscape Ecology. Similarly, we will add the code of some ggplot2 graphics and a short explanation of them for better use and reproducibility in your research articles.
