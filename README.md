# Landscape Ecology with R
This page was created to provide an additional option to quantify landscape configuration using R. The landscape subject to analysis is powerful and can represent any spatial phenomenon. R will quantify, sample, show, and the areal extent and spatial configuration of patches within a landscape. We will cover a few important steps for data analysis and visualization.
